# SRE Study Notes

My comprehensive journey through Site Reliability Engineering concepts, tools, and projects.

This vault contains study notes, projects, and documentation organized by topic. Each major area has its own folder with a landing page (README) that provides an overview and links to detailed notes and projects.

## Study Areas

- [Linux](./Linux/README.md) - Operating system fundamentals and system administration
- [IaC](./IaC/README.md) - Infrastructure as Code (planned)
- [Docker](./Docker/README.md) - Containerization and orchestration (planned)
- [Kubernetes](./Kubernetes/README.md) - Container orchestration (planned)
- [Networking](./Networking/README.md) - Network fundamentals (planned)
- [Monitoring](./Monitoring/README.md) - Observability and alerting (planned)
- [Cloud](./Cloud/README.md) - Multicloud Infrastructure (planned)
- [AI](./AI/README.md) - AI for SREs (planned)

## Projects

- [Projects](./Projects/README.md) - Overarching projects and portfolio pieces

## How This Works

Each study area follows this structure:
- **README.md**: Landing page with overview, progress, and links to projects
- **Project folders**: Individual projects with their own README (blog-style documentation)
- **Study notes**: Detailed technical notes from learning sessions

All content is version controlled and synced across my devices via iCloud and Git.
