# SRE Study Notes: Infrastructure Reliability & Automation

## Site Reliability Engineering | Systems Automation | Infrastructure-as-Code

This repository documents the automation frameworks, system internals, and reliability patterns I employ to manage high-availability infrastructure.  
With **15+ years** of experience in enterprise infrastructure, my focus is on **eliminating operational toil** by bridging the gat between physical connectivity and software-defined reliability.

## 🛠️ Core Competencies

- Reliability Engineering: Proactive monitoring, incident response, and post-mortem analysis.
- Network Automation: Scaling complex network topologies through Python and IaC.
- Systems Architecture: Deep-dive Linux internals, kernel tuning, and distributed systems.
- Statistical modeling for SLIs/SLOs and error budget management.

## 🏗️ Technical Roadmap

This vault contains study notes, projects, and documentation organized by topic.  
Each major area has its own folder with a landing page (README) that provides an overview and links to detailed notes and projects.

| Domain | Focus | Key Deliverable |
| ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| **Linux Systems** | Kernel, LVM, & Permissions | **Systems Mastery** & Security Audit Framework |
| **Cloud & IaC** | Terraform & AWS Architecture | **Zero-Trust VPC Factory** & IaC Patterns |
| **Orchestration** | Docker & Kubernetes | **High-Availability Clusters** & Orchestrated Workloads |
| **Observability** | Prometheus, Grafana, & SLIs | **The 'Golden Signals' Dashboard** & Statistical Reliability Monitoring |

## Study Areas

- [Linux](./Linux/README.md) - Operating system fundamentals and system administration
- [IaC](./IaC/README.md) - Infrastructure as Code
- [Cloud](./Cloud/README.md) - Cloud Infrastructure (planned)
- [Docker_and_K8s](./Docker_and_K8s/README.md) - Containerization and Orchestration (planned)
- [Monitoring](./Monitoring/README.md) - Observability and alerting (planned)

## Projects

- [Projects](./Projects/README.md) - Overarching projects and portfolio pieces that tie together multiple study areas

## How This Works

Each study area follows this structure:
- **README.md**: Landing page with overview, progress, and links to projects
- **Project folders**: Individual projects with their own README
- **Study notes**: Detailed technical notes from learning sessions

All content is version controlled and synced across my devices via iCloud, Git, and Obsidian. All notes are written in markdown.
