# manage_processes_and_logging

## Key Concepts

whenever a program is launched, a process is created

for logging, `/var/log/` is the most commonly stored spot for log files

## Commands & Examples

`ps` is the most commonly used utility to glean information about processes
    `ps` supports both unix and posix options but the letters are for different things
    `ps ax` shows all processes
    `u` flag is for displaying in "user-oriented" format
    `pid number` lets you narrow it down to whatever process you want to see
    `-U` to specify a user
    `f` can be added to show a tree-like output (useful for seeing parents)

`top` can be used to get a live view of the resources used by active processes
    `q` to quit

services also have a "niceness" value that ranges from -20 to 19. The lower the number, the less "nice" the process is
    a lower number means a higher priority (more greedy) to take more resources
`nice -n [value] [pid]` sets a value for a process
`renice [new_value] [pid]` changes the niceness value of a running process

`kill` lets you send different signals to a process directly (useful if something is hanging for example)
    `-l` shows you a listing of the different signals you can send

`<C-z>` Control-z lets you send a process to the background (but it will not continue running)
add an `&` to a command if you want the process to continue in the background
`bg [job_number]` will make a job in the background start running
`fg` brings a process back to the foreground (specify the job number if you have multiple)
use `jobs` command if you want to see the various processes in the background

`lsof -p [pid]` shows which files/directories a process is using

`tail -F /var/log/auth.log` lets you "follow" logs as they get added to a file

`journalctl` is the modern utility for working with logs
    you can filter for logs generated by a specific command
    `journalctl /usr/bin/sudo` will show you logs related to the `sudo` command
    `-e` to jump to the end
    `-f` to "follow"
    `-p` to filter by priority level (alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, info, notice, warning)
    `-g` lets you add `grep` patterns for filtering

## Questions & Notes

Processes inherit their niceness value from their parents
Non-root user can only assign niceness values from 0 to 19. `sudo` is required for lower values
SIGTERM (essentially a graceful shutdown) is the default signal sent to a process when a specific signal is not defined
