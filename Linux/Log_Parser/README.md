# Log Parser

## Overview

Python script that uses RegEx to parse logs and find IPs that are creating errors (as well as counting them)

## The Challenge

Scanning `/var/log/syslog` manually for errors is inefficient and prone to human error

## The Solution

A Python script using Regular Expressions (regex) to identify and count error patterns

### Implementation Logic

Python's `re` module is much easier to use than trying to search with standard Linux commands and regex

### Reliability Considerations

*(What did you add to make the script "harder to break")*

## Key Learnings

An easier way to use regex

## Code Implementation

*(Links to code files and explanations)*

## Results

*(Outcomes and impact)*

*(Add a screenshot or code block showing the output of the script)*
